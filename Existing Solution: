Time and access can be obstacles to library research. 
Readers must get to the library during library hours, which may not be convenient.
They also may need to stay in the library for a long time to ensure they have exhausted all resources. 
Some resources may not be available for checkout, which means the student must stay in the library to use them. And those that do circulate may be checked out by others and unavailable to anyone else.
